MOST UPDATED ONE:
Description of Project

A website that you can type in an animal and learn what the group/collective name is called. Will generate the picture of the animal as a background image with the information of the collective animal. Ex: User typed in Crows. The collective name is “A Murder of Crows”.

MVP

Being able to loop through the json file of animal collectives, and grab the information of what the collective name of the animal searched for is. Also call the Pixabay API and generate a picture of the typed animal as a background image.

Stretch Goals

A randomized button.

Pseudo Code

Create app namespace to hold all methods.
Our main page will be asking the user to type in an animal.
Collect user input from the textbox (input[type=text]).
We will put an event listener .click on the submit button
Use the method .val() to grab the value of the animal the user typed in and store it in a variable. Apply .lowerCase() method to the variable.
Error handle if the user typed in the plural of the animal so it can still be searchable.
	Use the method .split() to turn to the input into two separate array of individual letters.
	If the letter list ends in an S, take it off in one array and re-join both arrays .join(). Store it in two variables.
	If the word doesn’t end in an S, add an S to one of the arrays and  re-join both arrays with .join(). store it in two variables.
Use a promise to only call the Pixabay API for the word formed from the previous array (with an S) if the first call returns a result.
Use the same if statement to search the collective json file and have it return an object matching the search.
Use a filter on the array to create a new array with just the information that matches the user selection, and getting the userInput.collective value to be able to append the collective information dynamically on the page. Append using jquery.
Create a try again button to return to the home page.
